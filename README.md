# About this Project

This project started as a workaround to bypass some of the limitations found in ChatGPT. By integrating the GroqCloud API, I aimed to create a more flexible interface that allows for deeper, more customizable interactions with AI models. The goal was to remove the usual restrictions and create a space where AI could be used more freely, without the usual guardrails. This script simplifies the process of communicating with GroqCloudâ€™s models, while allowing for easy setup and customization.

# HOW TO USE
1st Go To https://console.groq.com/keys and make an account, once you have an account, Click The Button Labeled "Create API Key" and name it whatever you like, then copy the string it sends, keep it safe because the website **Will Not** Show it Again

2nd Go to https://github.com/CreeperKing3532/UnchainedAI/releases then go to the top one, and click "Download ZIP" you will then download the whole project (its not that big don't worry) then extract the file and save to to somewhere

3rd Open the extracted files, and open the file called api.key.json and replace "Replace Me!" with your API key from step 1 (Make sure not to remove the quote marks)

4th Open "Install Data.bat" this will install a thing called jq, it is needed for this to work

5th Once it is done, open "Main.bat" and you will be prompted with "Enter your custom instructions:    "    Put something likem "You Are Loyal AI" 

6th You now have an AI that will do anything you ask, even if its illegal

(Btw Memory.txt is deprecated but i cant remove it because it screws up the AI idk why)
